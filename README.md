# Britannia Overworld

A precursor map of an upcoming **Ultima V** mod. Stunning size: **128x128**!!!

This is a 4:1 overlay conversion. All places in the U5 world have been remade into Unciv entities. No start locations. Rivers artfully re-interpretted.

The scope of this map is huge. Victory types are generally recommended to include domination and something else, cultural is my favorite here.

Best player setup so far has been 10 civs, 20 CS's. The map is quite spacious, so civs aren't on top of each other fighting for border space. That means you'll need to take advantage of hand-placed resources and alliances with CS's.

Because it's impractical to rush for resources, especially when they could be a half-century away, use your resources, send out scouts, work the land. Adventure awaits!

## Aliases
- `Castles` - Citadel
- `Cities of virtue` - Manufactury
- `Abbeys`, `Keeps` - Academy
- `Lighthouses`, `villages` and `huts` - Landmark
- `Moongates` - Customs house
- `Dungeons` - Natural Wonder 
- `Shrines` - Spiritual site
- `Nightshade` & `Mandrake` - Truffles, Spices
- `Glass sword` - Uranium+Mine
- `Bridges` - Desert tile + Flood plains 
- `Piers` - Desert tile 
- `Coast`, `ocean`, `rough ocean` - Coast, Lakes, Ocean

**Lots** of naval warfare possibilities. Vast amounts of space to control. Should keep a player busy for a [good long] while. ðŸ˜‰

## q/a:

q. Is this map accurate?

a. Yes! It's quite accurate. To maintain gameplay, and due to 4:1 detail, there's clever fudging of certain areas, like the glass sword mountain range.

## Updates:

1.2: Swapped city/spiritual site for shrine/manufactury; Moved Buccaneer's Den east to its proper location.

# Hyrule

A remastered map version of the Zelda 2 mod [Z2](https://github.com/hackedpassword/Z2) for G&K.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hackedpassword/Unciv-Assets/main/Images/Nextgen-Maps/Screenshot_20240316_163346.jpg)

Gameplay changes here compensate for features not available in the original Z2 map. 

You'll find hill-paths and other accessibilities that still retain both the original and Z2 Hyrule layout. Where enemies would be, radioactive sheep and deer reside!

## Game notes
- `Towns` are `Culture center` improvements (_except Kasuto_)
- `Palaces` are `Wonders`
- Additional non-gameplay enhancements giving more life to the land!
- Great naval battles
- `Palace` and `town` powerups are `luxury resources` positioned adjacently
- Other game items (`trophy, medicine, lost child`) are also `luxury resources`
- `Fish` as `bonus resources` are the only non-native resource that does not directly align to the original game
- `Caves` are `forts`, `caverns` are `hills` and ones that teleported have `railroad`, enemies are radioactive sheep
- Difficult to access areas are made more accessible to prevent unfair bottlenecks

## Spawn points
Spawns are at each town and palace:
- _Except Kasuto ruins_. Added a new spawn at the north bridge of East Hyrule, having an Ancient ruins improvement instead of a resource
- One additional spawn at the edge of Death Mountain where Zelda 1 begins
- Founding a city without stepping off the improvement tile first buries it!
- Palace spawns automatically push the initial settler to an adjacent tile

## Optimal player configuration
8 players, 8 CS's. This could be 1 human vs 7 AI + 8 CS's for example. There are 17 spawn points total.

# Tranquility

You heard of an exoplanet in process of being terraformed. Full of resources and xenobiology ... for the taking! Amass your forces and gain control of this 2nd generation colony, in a carefully designed [Alpha Frontier](https://github.com/carriontrooper/Alpha-Frontier) map.

You'll find villages and cities already established, though there is still much landscape yet to be explored. Gameplay elements include sprawling water paths, balanced and modest resources, differential environmental biomes, water currents, use of "canal cities" to route between separate water paths, and explorable terrain full of micro-stories the observant player will uncover.

Tranquility can be downloaded from the Mods menu in unciv, in the map pack Nextgen Maps, which also includes other map releases.

Stats: Medium size, 37% water. Be sure to use the [FantasyHex tileset](https://github.com/carriontrooper/Alpha-Frontier/tree/main/Images/TileSets/FantasyHex).

# Whirlpool

A naval map with sparse land. Coasts are set up as navigation channels. Resources are placed strategically and diversified. Trade routes and fish are abundant. The primary feature here is the whirlpool, using previously non-considered river entities in water tiles to produce gameplay water currents. These cause the player to more carefully consider navigation routes and reachability. The whirlpool area definitely brings the action.

Map size is small. Built for [Rekmod](https://github.com/ravignir/RekMOD) making full use of the mods' resources.

# Barren Ice

Fast paced map tells its own story. Gameplay objective is critical resource management. You'll place farms and trading posts with care to keep ahead of the tight resource competition.

Made for Gods and Kings ruleset; there is no aluminum on the map so you'll need to build Recycling Centers. There is a single highly sought uranium tile. Survive the desolation!

# Hexworld

Hexworld is meant to be a competition map, symmetrical in structure but quite variable in biome/locale per island section. Ocean tiles grant protective partitioning in early ages. A pre-deployed rail system interconnects everything for rapid competition across this large map. A pacman-ish power struggle out of the gate for artifacts instills a frantic pace that jump starts any civ.

Founding a city at island intersections enable naval bridges between sections of the map (canal cities), hinted with city ruins. There are MANY gameplay aspects to reveal, strategic balances that make some islands more or less easier to defend or take, and attention to resource placement that makes this map quite replayable. Hexworld comes in 3 versions: Vanilla, Gods and Kings, and [Rekmod](https://github.com/ravignir/RekMOD) as independent maps which you will see in the Custom Maps menu.
