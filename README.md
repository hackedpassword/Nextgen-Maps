# Nextgen-Maps
Most fun and well-designed maps! Current maps include: Barren Ice, Hexworld, Whirlpool, Tranquility

## Tranquility

You heard of an exoplanet in process of being terraformed. Full of resources and xenobiology ... for the taking! Amass your forces and gain control of this 2nd generation colony, in a carefully designed [Alpha Frontier](https://github.com/carriontrooper/Alpha-Frontier) map.

You'll find villages and cities already established, though there is still much landscape yet to be explored. Gameplay elements include sprawling water paths, balanced and modest resources, differential environmental biomes, water currents, use of "canal cities" to route between separate water paths, and explorable terrain full of micro-stories the observant player will uncover.

Tranquility can be downloaded from the Mods menu in unciv, in the map pack Nextgen Maps, which also includes other map releases.

Stats: Medium size, 37% water. Be sure to use the [FantasyHex tileset](https://github.com/carriontrooper/Alpha-Frontier/tree/main/Images/TileSets/FantasyHex).

## Whirlpool

A naval map with sparse land. Coasts are set up as navigation channels. Resources are placed strategically and diversified. Trade routes and fish are abundant. The primary feature here is the whirlpool, using previously non-considered river entities in water tiles to produce gameplay water currents. These cause the player to more carefully consider navigation routes and reachability. In testing, the whirlpool area definitely brought the action.

Tested with 3 civ, 1 state, plus player. Size is small. Built for rekmod making full use of the mods' game resources.
